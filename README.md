# ☕ The Java Experiment

This repository contains experimental codes I wrote to discover the characteristics and behaviors of Java. The classes I followed were presented by Tim Buchalka, at the course 'Java Programming Masterclass' available at [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/).

Java is a object-oriented programming language designed by James Gosling along with his team. The principle behind this language is to allow applications to run regardless of the machine's operating system. To perform like that, Java has on its core the concept of virtual machine, provided by the JVM —  **Java Virtual Machine**. But this programming language is not only build upon a virtual machine. To compile and execute without errors, our program needs the Java Development Kit (JDK) to be properly installed. So for running this repository localy, we need to make sure we have the Java Development Kit (JDK) in our machine. The instructions bellow will give us a glimpse of that. 🖥

### 🛠️ JDK installation guide
Open you terminal and paste the following:
```bash
java --version
```
In case you have already installed the JDK, the output should be more or less like this:
```
java --version
openjdk 17.0.7 2023-04-18
```
If so, we are free to go! ️If not, whether your operating system is Linux, Windows, or MacOs, I recommend you to follow the instructions directly at Oracle's official documentation, found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/index.html#Java-Platform%2C-Standard-Edition).

### 🛠  ️IDE (Integrated Development Environments) installation guide
Once you've done that, we can pick the IDE to execute the code given by this repo. I'm currently using VSCode, but many developers use Eclipse for running Java programs. For this last option, you can follow the instructions and download Eclipse for free in [this link](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)! ✨

And for the ones that intent to follow this tutorial using VSCode let's check if it is already installed locally by running in the terminal, once again, the following command:
```bash
code --version
```
If it is already installed, this is the expected output,
```
1.79.2
```
Note that you might notice a different version according to the one available on your machine. For more infos about it we can check over [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#:~:text=Update%201.79.,-2%3A%20The%20update&text=Welcome%20to%20the%20May%202023,your%20workspace%20as%20read%2Donly.). And for those who does not have VSCode installed, this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) provides the proper guide to download it.

>> Note that the installation of the preferred IDE does not replace the ` JDK installation guid` part. Make sure you have properly followed the provided instructions in order to run the codes provided in this repository! 😃

### ✅ Ok, now I think we are finally free to go!

But first, lemme put the references I used to write this doc:
* [Java (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
* [JAVA E A ORIENTAÇÃO A OBJETOS](https://www.caelum.com.br/apostila/apostila-java-orientacao-objetos.pdf) (pt-br)

I also need to add that this repo is currently under construction... 
... and It would be a pleasure to read any idea of yours to build or improve it! 💕

LETSSSSSS DO EEET!!! #CodeOn
